# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: travel-nest-clone 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: I need you to help me create an Airbnb clone. It should look as close as possible to the image attached. Please pay attention to the header (use it as a separate component, as we will be using it on other pages). Also, make sure that in the header, there is a user menu where I can click and an option to Log in.

For login functionality, just show a modal dialog where I can enter admin/admin for both user name and password. Use fake auth, no need to integrate with any services. Once I'm successfully logged in, make sure I can also logout (as an option in user menu). Once logged in, I should be able to have an option called My Trips in the user menu. For now just create that page as a placeholder, I'll tell you later what I need to be put there. Make sure this page also has a header so I can easily navigate back to hompegae or Access my user menu.
